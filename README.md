# SOS-device-prototype
Affordable wearable SOS device for families to alert in emergencies.

## Overview
This project is an **SOS wearable device** designed for emergency situations such as floods, kidnapping, or accidents.  
By pressing a button, the device triggers:
- 🔊 Buzzer alarm  
- 💡 LED alert  
- 📡 GPS location tracking (demo coordinates in prototype)  
- 📲 GSM/SMS alert to family or rescue team  

The goal is to create a **low-cost safety device** that every family can afford, while also exploring premium and military-grade versions.  
Now the project also includes **basic GSM and GPS integration in prototype stage**.

## Why This Project?
In India and many countries, the **per capita income is low** but the need for affordable safety devices is high.  
This project aims to **save lives** in disasters (like floods) and emergencies, while being **cost-friendly for families**.  

Long term vision:
- 🚀 Expand to premium military use  
- 🌍 Collaborate with governments and universities (like NUS Singapore)  
- 💡 Inspire more students to build real-world safety solutions
