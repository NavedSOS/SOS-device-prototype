# 🚨 SOS Device Prototype
Affordable wearable SOS device for families to alert in emergencies.

---

## 📌 Overview
The **SOS Device Prototype** is a low-cost wearable designed for emergency situations such as floods, kidnapping, or accidents.  
By pressing a button, the device triggers:  
- 🔊 Buzzer alarm  
- 💡 LED alert  
- 📍 GPS location tracking (prototype uses demo coordinates)  
- 📲 GSM/SMS alert to family or rescue team  

The vision is to make **safety accessible for every family** in India and worldwide, while also exploring **premium and military-grade versions**.
