# SOS-device-prototype
Affordable wearable SOS device for families to alert in emergencies.

## Overview
This project is an **SOS wearable device** designed for emergency situations such as floods, kidnapping, or accidents.  
By pressing a button, the device triggers:
- 🔊 Buzzer alarm
- 💡 LED alert
- (Future) 📡 GPS + GSM message to family or rescue team

The goal is to create a **low-cost safety device** that every family can afford, while also exploring premium and military-grade versions.
