# Hardware Plan for SOS Device

## 1. Core Components
- **Microcontroller (MCU):** ESP32 (low-cost, WiFi + Bluetooth support).
- **Power Supply:** Rechargeable Li-ion battery (long backup).
- **GPS Module:** For real-time location tracking.
- **GSM/4G Module:** To send SOS alerts (SMS or internet-based).
- **Button/Switch:** One-touch SOS trigger.
- **Vibration Motor / LED:** Feedback for user when SOS is sent.
- if possible then Arduino nano
- or Arduino nano
## 2. Form Factor
- Wearable as **bracelet, pendant, or keychain**.
- Lightweight and water-resistant.

## 3. Safety & Reliability
- Long battery life (at least 48 hrs standby).
- Tamper-proof casing.
- Fast response (<5 seconds to send alert).

## 4. Future Enhancements
- Add fall detection using motion sensors.
- Integration with mobile app (via Bluetooth).
- Solar charging for outdoor use.
