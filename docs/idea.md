# SOS Device Idea

## Problem
Many families, especially in low-income regions, don’t have access to fast emergency alert systems. In floods, accidents, or kidnappings, time is critical — but calling or texting often takes too long.

## Solution
A low-cost wearable SOS device (bracelet, necklace, or pocket-sized) that:
- Works with one button press.
- Sends the user’s location to a secure server.
- Instantly notifies parents/guardians on their phone.
- Optional: vibration or LED feedback so the user knows the SOS is sent.

## Target Users
- Families with children
- Elderly people
- Women’s safety
- Disaster response (floods, earthquakes)

## Long-Term Vision
- Create both an affordable version for ordinary families.
- Build an advanced, premium version for military & government use.
- Connect the device to a mobile app for tracking and history.
- Expand to international markets (India, Singapore, global).
